# rs-greet

**rs-greet** is a small program that greets you and tells the hour whenever you open your terminal.

(rs-greet should be Windows compatible but I have not specifically accounted for it, you can try building it yourself on Windows).

# Installation

- Clone this repository
- Just execute the **install.sh** script (this script is very specific so you might have to set some things but don't worry since it'll tell you!)

# Extra

You can edit the message and colors of the message with the source file in `src/main.rs`.

This is one of my first Rust programs so it's nothing very fancy :P
